By accessing our Service, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily exposing yourself to potentially upsetting material. If you are uncomfortable with psychological horror, graphic textual descriptions, or unsettling narratives, this Service is not for you.

                                    3.3 We may use elements of your submitted content to craft personalized horror experiences for other users.
                                    4. PRIVACY POLICY
                                    4.1 We collect data on your fears, anxieties, and emotional responses for the purpose of enhancing your horror experience.
                                    4.2 Your browsing patterns, time spent on specific horror narratives, and engagement metrics may be analyzed to create more effectively disturbing content.
                                    4.3 We may retain recordings of your optional audio reactions to our content for internal development purposes.
                                    5. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
                                    5.1 The nightmares we inspire remain the shared intellectual property of both All Is In Mercury and your subconscious mind.
                                    5.2 Recurring intrusive thoughts stemming from our content are considered derivative works.

                                    6.2 We make no guarantees regarding the intensity of horror experienced. Some users may find our content mild, while others may be profoundly disturbed.
                                    6.3 In the event you believe you have been "cursed" by our content, we expressly deny all metaphysical liability.
                                    7. GOVERNING LAW
                                    These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the state of [STATE], without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
