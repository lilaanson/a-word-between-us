    title: "One more story about a ghost saying hello", 
    content: `My mother's father left, on purpose, shortly before my mother was born. This would have been at the very end of 1929. My mother never knew him, or much about him. She tracked him down when she was an adult, around the time of my birth. She said that she knocked on his door, but he refused to answer. She begged him, but he refused to open the door, she left in tears. I was unpacking stuff a few years ago, when I came across a picture that my mother had framed. It was a very elderly couple. I remember that the picture was very precious to my mother, but I forgot anything that she told me about the picture and who the elderly couple was. The picture looked old, and the couple looked like they were in their 90's. They are standing outside in farm clothes. I was about to find out who they were. I found an online ancestry site that I did not have to pay for to look at. I started searching for people on my mother's side. Someone had taken the time to upload some great old items that were connected to the family. My mother's father had an unusual name, so that made the search so much easier. There was an obituary, dated the year my mother was born. The obituary was for a Union soldier who 'Marched with General Sherman To Sea'. I recognized his picture immediately. He was the elderly man in the picture. He was my mother's paternal grandfather. Then when I searched my mother's father, I found a WW1 draft registration. It said that he was employed at a lumber mill. I also found a census entry for him. A few weeks/months later, I had a vivid lucid dream. I was outside, walking along a long outdoor pond. There were flowers, like an old public garden. The pond was obviously dug out, it was a long rectangular shape. Suddenly I was in the pond, my head held well above the surface. I could physically feel someone strong holding me as they swam to the other side. I got to the other side, and was once again on land. A voice or a psychic impression said to me, as the body held me up and swiftly carried me across. It told me, 'That is your grandfather, he looks out for you'. I woke up crying.
 The only grandfather I knew was my dad's dad. The last time I saw him, I was four years old and he appeared to be dying of emphysema. He was not the type of grandpa who doted on his grand kids. I was puzzled when I woke up, because something told me that the grandfather spirit who carried me across the pond, was my grandfather. A few weeks later, it dawned on me. That grandfather spirit was probably my mother's father. The son of the Union soldier, now elderly man in the photograph. I believe that he was able to redeem himself after death, for the wrongs he committed in life. I believe that he somehow reached out to me from the spirit world. Probably prompted from me finding the little snips of info that I found online. The WW1 draft registration card had his signature, his lovely penmanship, on the bottom. Maybe when I looked at it, I got a psychic impression that allowed for him to reach out to me, somehow.`,

(So: just to clarify - your vision of being carried in the pond- this is a memory of something that happened to you in this life- is that right? And perhaps his spirit was the one who helped you get to safety?) I love this. I am going to start looking into my ancestors now, too, and hopefully will also develop a connection with them :)", isOP: false}

    content: "Around 2 a.m., I woke up needing to pee. Still half asleep, I stumbled my way to the toilet. When I got there, I heard the sound of water running from inside. Assuming someone was using it, I waited. But even after ten minutes, the water was still running. There were no other sounds, no voices, no phone noises, nothing. It felt strange because you‚Äôd usually hear something when people were inside. I was on the verge of peeing myself, so I knocked on the door and said, ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ I really have to pee. Are you almost done?‚Äù There was no reply. I knocked again, but this time, the running water stopped. Both stalls fell silent. I expected someone to come out, but no one did. The silence was unsettling. I knocked once more, and to my surprise, the locked stall door swung open from the force of my knock. Inside, it was pitch dark. No one was there. Weirdly enough, I wasn‚Äôt scared. I just really had to pee. I quickly went inside. As I relieved myself, I kept thinking about how clearly I had heard the sound of water running into a bucket. But now, the bucket was completely empty. The floor was dry, with no signs of water. I felt ridiculous, angry even, for wasting over ten minutes waiting for no one. After I was done, I went back to my room and fell asleep, maybe it was because I was still half asleep I kind of brush it off.",

It all started when my grandmother went on vacation with my brother (he lived with her). i stayed in his bedroom which was in the basement. Ever since i was small that basement freaked me out. I was staying for a week and a few days passed then one night i woke up from my sleep feeling off idk what woke me up but something did i laid back down trying to go back to sleep then i heard knocking on the front door i got up and headed up the stairs and then the knocking got more and more aggressive i ran to the door thinking ‚Äúoh god something happened‚Äù i dont remember what compelled me but i unlocked the door and opened it without checking who it was outside (i never do this. im very cautious). i stepped outside like REALLY stepped out like i was at the end of the driveway. At this point i was freaking out and went back in and locked the door. i convinced myself i heard something and went back to bed. i don‚Äôt know when i fell asleep but i did. not for long tho it was still pitch black out by the time i was woken up again. i was woken up by the sound of someone whispering terrified i frozen in bed and realized it was coming from the little window by the ceiling of the basement. i just stared for a second thinking my neighbors were outside but then i heard a women say my name then a man then a women almost like people were taking turns whispering my name into the window. i got so scared i just sat there crying. i don‚Äôt remember when or how but i ended up asleep again. i called my mom explaining what happened in the morning. ever since then i couldn‚Äôt figure out if it was a dream or if it was real. Let me say that i felt everything during this the cold cement on my feet and everything i touched. if you have any idea let me know what you think ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

    content: "I heard this story from my grandmother. Even though I don't necessarily believe it, I felt it would be good to share, so here it is. This event took place in 1900 and involved one of my grandfather‚Äôs uncles. He used to graze cows in a field. Behind the field stood a temple dedicated to Kali. One day, as evening approached and the sun was setting, one of his cows suddenly ran off. When he went to retrieve the wandering cow, he noticed that it had headed in the direction of the Kali temple. There was no one around, and as he looked toward the temple and its idol, the statue‚Äôs face suddenly smiled at him. He was so frightened that he ran away. From that moment on, fear gripped him, and he began to suffer from stomach pain. Day by day, his condition worsened considerably. At night, he would hear eerie laughing sounds, and it felt as if someone was standing right outside his door. He spent his days in constant agony, crying out in pain, as if he were being relentlessly pursued by an unseen presence. So overwhelmed by fear that, each night, he lay in bed paralyzed, almost as if he had turned to wood, he eventually died.",

    title: "Hello from an old friend...", 
    content: "Last winter, I was randomly driving when I became puzzled, why was I suddenly remembering a former classmate, someone I only knew very briefly, in 7th grade. I was 60 yrs. old now. He was in my class, his name was Greg and he had wild, longish black hair with fair skin. He invited me over to his house one day after school. We were alone, he tried to make a pass at me. I left, turned him down and went home. I do not remember ever really seeing him again after that. So why on earth did I suddenly think of him? I was about to find out..... I got on FB a few days or week later. I decided to look at my old high school page online. I now live in a different state, I have not been anywhere near that high school, since probably 2008, and it was just a visit. Anyway, I see some posters that were displayed during a reunion. There, on 'Classmates we have lost', I see it. Greg. He was dead. I googled, found his memorial online and gleaned some info. His mother had wrote it. She mentioned how much Greg loved living in Hawaii. I was stationed in Hawaii, same time that he was there nearby. Greg died in a state near where I now live, he passed away around the time that I had gotten settled here. I have zero clue why Greg would randomly reach out to me, of all people, to say hello from beyond. I wish him peace. I have no idea how he died.",

    title: "Banshee", 
    content: "Banshee??????? So this happened when my brother and I were maybe 11 and 12 We lived in a rural town. A town with a nice mix of busy streets and at the time, sprawling farms. My family home was the second last house in the last neighbourhood before you hit farm land as far as the eye could see. To the right of my house was my neighbours, then a thick hedgerow which separated the housing estate from the farm. The first 5 or 6 fields in this part of the farm grew barley and wheat. As kids we made tunnels through the hedgerow and spent hours everyday during the summer exploring the farm with friends. Each field was huge and was separated from the neighbouring field by other large hedgerows, some complete with streams running through them. One night my little brother, our two best friends and myself were outside our house playing football and skateboarding. It was about 9.30 at night and quite dark. Remember, we are the second last house on the road in the very last housing estate before it was just barley as far as the eye could see. We were essentially the very edge of town.\n"+
    "Anyway, on this night we were hanging out as usual when suddenly we heard an ear piercing squal/ screech coming from the barley field beside us. It was so loud and high pitched that it took our attention in an instant. It had a feeling of panic about it yet it was kinda funny to our young minds. We decided to go investigate thinking it was a pig or an injured animal of some description. So in our youthful excitement we burrow through the hedgerow and start running towards the origin of the sound all laughing in excitement. The barley was ready to be plucked from the earth so it was high. Up past our waists so we couldn't see anything that may be on the ground injured. As we get close to where the sound Is coming from it suddenly stopped. We stop and look at each other laughing then it starts again but now it is originating from the point of the field which we first entered. We exchanged glances in confusion before sprinting towards the sound believing it must be a scared injured animal. Then the sound stops before immediately starting again directly behind us... this time it sounded ominous and the feeling changed. The sound then stopped again, starting instantly but way way off in the distance. It moved towards us at speeds way too fast for an animal. Just as it reached us it stopped and again came from the totally different end of field hurtling towards us in pitch black. Now we are frightened.. this is not an injured animal. We've no idea what it is. The sound then seems to stop and start from everywhere, moving with incredible speeds all around us, covering huge distances in seconds. Without saying a word, we all run as fast as possible back to the hedgerow, which we entered. All the while, this loud, screeching, wailing moves all around us. My younger brother begins crying in fear as we all rush to get back into our neighbourhood under street lights near our home. As soon as we cross the threshold. The high-pitched screaming chasing behind us stopped at the border. We were all physically shaken and scared now. My little brother was hysterical for weeks, refusing to go back into the field even during a sunny day.A few years later, my brother would tragically die suddenly in that house. Many strange sightings of a withered woman were reported around those fields over the years. If anyone is familiar with the legend of the banshee, let me know what you think. This occurred in Ireland, as you've probably guessed.",

At this point I'd just recommend reading The Satanic Bible by Anton LeVay.  Even if this is not the Satanism you are looking fire this is where Satanism all started. From there, read about the Temple of Set to see how a more theistic path if the adversary emerged. Then finish the trilogy if reading by reading up on The Satanic Temple and the work they are doing. By then you should have a general overview of the history and who everyone is. If instead you want to know about actual worshipping of the devil according to the accusations of the church from the 1500s and 1600s onwards ..you need to read anthropological texts and look into both cunning golf and esp. folkloric witchcraft.", isOP: false},

    content: `I was little when this happened. I remembered how I read in the news about missing children around my age. Some have been gone for days...others have been gone for years. I didn't understand what was going on until one day the window to my bedroom opened. A man climbed in and walked to my bed. He looked at me while his hand covering my mouth and said "Let's fly my lost boy" after that I don't remember anything because he threw some powder in my eyes. I blacked out. I woke up in a room chained up with a couple of other boys. One of them looked 12. The reason why I pointed him out was because the man came out and dragged him to a room. What I heard was the most horrifying thing a 5 year old could hear. I heard bones crushing and you can hear the skinned being ripped from the body and the smacking of his lips when he was done ripping it. The boy screamed and cried for help be we couldn't do anything about it. I felt helpless. I was helpless. Each day I was there a new kid came and the other was eaten by that man. Soon enough I was turning 12 the next day. The man came out to drag me but I fought back. I managed to escape but I lost my hand...it didn't matter I rather lose a hand than stay there. I ran and ran until I was out of breathe. I've found my family n told the police but he was never caught...

That happened 15 years ago and I didn't remember until today...that was because I turned on the news and this is what it said: "Parents please be careful there is a Bogeyman out there taking children from the ages of 3-11 years old. Well have more information after the break".`,

        {text: `usually you need to be a satan worshipper but i think you can do this

you need a candle usually 10 or 8 of them and you will arrange them in a circle

after that you need a knife and a chalk

draw a pentagram on the circle candle and chant

uipahhle lupioeahhp naaeted uaula onmneeea lactlado

chant it over and over with the knife cut your palm

and put your blood on the penta

if it doesn't work then you have sold your soul to the devil

if you see your uncle is a little transparent dont talk to him hes not your uncle

if hes a little black dont talk to him he will curse you

if hes normal and hes wearing blue clothes then you can talk to him
