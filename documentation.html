                    <p>The internet is its own medium—a fusion of image, video, sound, and story. <br><br>
                        Internet experiences aren't new—mysteries and horrors have long lurked in the corners of the web, waiting to be discovered.<br><br>
                        This is one of those experiences.

            <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
            <p>Our design inspiration comes from early 2000s websites like Myspace and Neocities. Both of these resources allow users to customize their virtual space, so the designs were very distinct, themed, and personal.<br><br>
                    We lean into beginner HTML/CSS/JS styles to reflect the story of a small creator just building something for himself and a few friends—something that accidentally grew into a tight-knit community.</p>

            <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
            <h4>Early Mockups</h4>
            <p>The earliest designs were mainly for testing what functions could appear where rather than on the actual design.</p>

            <p>The first significant design matched an early 2000s cyber aesthetic and was created on figma and then interated on within the HTML, CSS, and JS. Although we moved away from this design, it helped create the spacing which remains relatively similar.</p>

            <p>The goal is to make each user feel like they're having a unique experience—one that's different even from the person who visited the site just before them. To start, the site prompts them to create an account.
            </p>

            <p>The chat feature occasionally receives strange messages—random chatter, chainmail, and even complaints about the chainmail. Users can send their own messages and will occasionally get a response, adding to the unpredictability of the experience.

            <p>The website is filled with content that branches away from the main storylines, inspired by old Reddit horror pages. Some entries are cryptic and unsettling, others are full-fledged stories. To help users navigate this chaotic archive, a “See Similar” section surfaces related content by matching keywords—offering a thread to follow through the madness.

            <h4>Physical Elements: Body</h4>
            <p>The silhouette of a volunteer was traced onto folded fabric that was then cut out and sewn together. Prior to sewing the dummy body shut, a wire skeleton was sculpted and placed inside so that the body could be posed, and finally the body was stuffed. A plastic tub was combined with tubing to store and pump the fake blood through the tubings that went inside the dummy’s arms and neck and out into blood bags.

The final cast was made with liquid latex and strips of an absorbent fabric to prevent tearing, and the cured silicone was coated in baby powder to prevent sticking. The cast was colored using SFX makeup.

            <h4>Physical Elements: Moving Arm</h4>
            <p>Dowels had holes drilled through the side and into the top of them allowing string to be looped through and secured, effectively making the joints/structure of the moving arm. A tube was sewn and filled with weighted pellets, then sewn off again to make two separate weights, which were then attached to the ends of each dowel, adding weight to the arm’s movement. Foam pieces were carved to fit the weights, and all elements were attached.

            <h4>Physical Elements: Tree</h4>
            <p>A wooden structure was made to ensure the size of the tree stump, and then chicken wire was placed to ensure the shape. A paper-mache like technique was used to cover the frame in cheap fabric and paper. The clay purchased was quite tough, and needed to be melted and mixed with petroleum jelly before it could be worked with. While in a liquid state, clay was placed over the paper-mache base, providing thickness and texture. Clay that had begun to cool was placed into the stamp mold and then along the tree stump. Once the tree was fully covered, it was spray painted, and some colorful details were added with SFX makeup. Foam was sculpted and painted to create a face, arm, and shoulder (the shoulder also acted as an anchor for the movement) to be added to the stump. Clay details were removed so that the foam pieces could be glued to the stump, and then another layer of paint was added all over to ensure consistent coloring. Fishing line was secured to the joints of the arm to allow easy control of the movement. The previously cast latex face was added to the foam base. Once all elements were secured, an uneven surface in the dirt was created for the stump to be placed on and partially buried. Organic elements such as grass and flowers were added to complete the look.

            <h3>Ashley Stafford</h3>
            <p>Ashley was responsible for the physical effects, video production, and narrative of the project. Their inspiration for the story came from a variety of horror projects, such as ARGs and movies, that are referenced in bits and pieces all throughout the project. Many of the effects were designed with the intention to provide experience with mold making, electronics, and puppetry, and as a result Ashley’s experience with such topics is greatly enhanced. With this project has come a variety of portfolio pieces that showcase Ashley’s ability to work with diverse materials in novel ways, creating engaging and innovative visuals to bring the narrative to life.

            <h3>Lila Anson</h3>

            <p>Lila was responsible for the technical development, user interaction design, and website architecture of the project. She built the forum-based web experience from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, implementing subtle unsettling elements and designs to support the horror narrative. Throughout the process, Lila navigated challenges related to data binding, handing large amounts of media, and simulating a functional yet eerie interface. The project became a space to deepen her understanding of JavaScript and overall web development while crafting a uniquely immersive digital experience.
